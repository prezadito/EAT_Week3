Encapsulation allows for the access of private data while still keeping them protected by the private keyword
Since private variables are only accessible within the same class, encapsulation is used to access private data from another class without exposing it
With encapsulation we can access a variable's data while not having access to the variable itself

Encapsulation is used to retrieve and return data in the form of a "capsule"
Data is retrieved using the gettr method (top layer of "capsule")
Data is returned using the settr method (bottom layer "capsule")

Create gettr/settr methods in the class where the protected variable(s) are
Call the gettr/settr methods in the class where you want to access them from

We can write code blocks inside the settr/gettr methods that set/return data based on pre-defined conditions (for ex: if/else statements)

Encapsulation = data hiding
