Overloading:
Same method with different parameters
Using two or methods belong to the same class, have the same name, but have more or different (type of) parameters (we "overloaded" the method)
You can overload a method as much as you want in the same class
Same "box" (method name) in the same "room" (class name), but we're filling it with more "stuff" (parameters and/or parameter data types)
Allows for the use of the same method in multiples ways, with multiple different parameters; all of the methods (with its different parameters) must be declared beforehand
A final method can be overloaded
Happens in compile time

Overriding:
Same method and parameters, but different body
Same method name (with the same parameters) in different classes (accessible via inheritance), but the method has a different body
In practice, this is done when the method is accessed by a class via inheritance from another class
Otherwise it's pointless to override a method that is declared within the same class as the method that is doing the overriding
Use the "@Override" annotation when overriding a method; place it right above the new method's declaration
A final method cannot be overridden
Happens in runtime
